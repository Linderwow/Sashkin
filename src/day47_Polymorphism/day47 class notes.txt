Polymorphism (Many forms): Ability of the objects to take on many forms
			  "IS A relation" is a must

			  Reference type is parent class/interface, and object type is child class

			  Reference type decides what can be accessed/called

			  Object type decides which implementation to execute

			    WebDriver driver = new FireFoxDriver();
		  		driver.takeScreenShot();

			  Animal animal = new Tiger();

			  Employee employee = new Developer();







Dynamic Polymorphism: Method overriding
					 One method with multiple implementations

					 eat():

					 implementation1: bakla
					 implementation2: Java
					 ...

Static Polymorphism: Method overloading
					Multiple methods with same name
					each method has one implementation ONLY

					add(byte, byte)
					add(integer, integer)
					add(Decimal, Decimal)


casting: converting one type to another

2 Types of Type castings:
		
		1. Primitive Type castings: must happen between primitives

				1.1 Implicit primitive type casting: casting smaller primitive type to large primitive type (done Implicitly)

									int a = 100;
									double b = a; // implicit casting


				1.2 Explicit primitive type casting: casting larger primitive type to smaller primitive type (done explicitly)

									long a = 100;
									short b = (short)a; //explicit casting


		2. Reference Type castings: THERE MUST BE INHERITANCE








Employee employee = new Tester();
employee.testing()
